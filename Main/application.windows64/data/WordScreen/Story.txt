Hi Good Morning Good Day Howdy Arey Yaar where the fuck are you? Hello Good Night guys Good Morning guys wtf???? let's hook up at my place tonight? Where are you???
Come fast Good night good morning.
Somehow, not only for Christmas,
But all the long year through,
The joy that you give to others,
Is the joy that comes back to you.
V oftn dnt xpress our feelngs for d fear of loosng a relatnsp, but d fact remain tat v oftn loose a b'ful relatnsp by not xpressng our feelngs..

D persn who loves u truly will trouble u more. 
But when u drop a tear she/he will fight with the world to stop ur tears.
Love them who loves you truly.

And the more you spend in blessing,
The poor and lonely and sad,
The more of your heart's possessing,
Returns to you glad.Take time to pray...
it helps to bring God near and washes the dust of earth from your eyes.

Take time for friends...
they are the source of happiness.

Take time for work...
it is the price of success.

Take time to think...
it is the source of power.

Take time to read...
it is the foundation of knowledge.

Take time to laugh...
it is the singing that helps with life's loads.

Take time to love...
it is the one sacrament of life.

Take time to dream...t hitches the soul to the stars.
Do u know why God created gaps between fingers? so that someone, who is very special to u comes and fills those gaps by holding your hands forever.

Do dil jaha milege, barsaat to ho jaayegee
dil se dil milegaa, najare kareege baate
dharkan badhege dil ki, aati rahegee yaade
teri churiyo ki khan khanahat, kano ko dhun sunaayege

Take time to play...
it is the secret of youth
